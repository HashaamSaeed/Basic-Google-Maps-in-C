## Functionality

The script includes the following functionality:

* Search: Users can look for specific locations within the city of Le Creusot, France.
* Path Planning: Users can find the shortest path between two locations within the city of Le Creusot, France.
* Dijkstra Algorithm: Used to find the shortest path between two locations when the user selects the "shortest path" option in the GUI.
* A* Algorithm: Used to find the optimal path between two locations when the user selects the "optimal path" option in the GUI.
* Graphical User Interface (GUI): Allows users to interact with the map and includes a map of the city of Le Creusot, France.

## GUI
The GUI includes the following features:

* Map of the city of Le Creusot, France
* Search bar for finding specific locations
* Path planning options for finding the shortest or optimal path
* Selection of starting and ending locations
* Display of the shortest or optimal path on the map

Implementation
The script is implemented in C++ and uses Dijkstra and A* algorithms for search and path planning functionalities. The GUI is also implemented using C++.
